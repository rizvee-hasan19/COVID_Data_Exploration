# COVID_Data_Exploration
In this project, I've made several queries on a public COVID dataset & observed the underlying trends in it to better understand the approaches needed to be taken. 
This data is now ready to be visualized in a visualization software like Tableaue or Power BI to give it more clarity and make it more easy to understand.
The data was first processed & cleaned in Excel and later queried in MS SQL server.
